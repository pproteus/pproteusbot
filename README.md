# pproteusbot v2
pproteusbot is a wrapper for a discord bot, as well as for connecting to other services.

- The bot collects plugins at runtime. This means plugins can be added or removed largely without fear of breaking anything.
- Plugins can define their own event loops, or subscribe to events defined by other plugins.
